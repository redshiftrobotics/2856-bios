<h2>Super CAD Expert and Build Master </h2>

<p>Samin has found that he loves CAD more than his mothers pancakes.  He is responsible for much of the design elements on the robot and is looking to continue his great designs.  Outside of robotics, he likes ultimate Frisbee and whittling.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>One memory he has from robotics is building a hanging mechanism in a day that worked! </p>

<p><strong>What he has learned from FIRST:</strong></p>
<p>Through FIRST, he learned that CAD is a valuable tool and yelling at teammates usually unproductive.</p>
