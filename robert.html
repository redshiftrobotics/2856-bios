<h2>Outreach Manager and Notebook Facilitator</h2>

<p>Outside of robotics, Robert loves to play tennis, practice the violin, and volunteer at the Woodland Park Zoo. He joined rebotics because he loves to build and has always been fascinated in the way robots work. Ever since he was young he has always been interested in building and the way things work. He has also improved his public speaking skills through outreach and made him a better teacher what he loves.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>One of his favorite outreach memories is when he was working with a student at Rotary Boys and Girls club. After his presentation about FIRST and what our robotics team does, one of the students said that he wanted to form his own robotics team! This was so inspiring for Robert, because he found it amazing to see that the work he does in outreach inspires students to love robotics. Rotary eventually did start a club, and he has gone back to help them with the team.</p>

<p><strong>What he has learned from FIRST:</strong></p>
<p>Robert has learned a lot about helping students through outreach programs and how he has inspired students to love robotics just as much as he does. Robert loves to teach students about robotics and how to get involved with robotics programs.</p>
