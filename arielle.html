<h2>Outreach manager and notebook facilitator</h2>

<p>Arielle is currently a builder and one of the leaders of outreach and the engineering notebook. She became interested after her year in FLL and seeing a demo that Red Shift showed during her visit day. She joined the team after doing soccer her freshman year and dedicated the rest of her years to robotics. Outside of robotics, Arielle works at Pacific Science Center and is a leader in her youth group.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>Taking on the formatting and presentation of the notebook last year for 2856 and being rewarded with the Think Award, because she realized how much the teamâ€™s hard work paid off! </p>

<p><strong>What he has learned from FIRST:</strong></p>
<p>Arielle has learned although failure is inevitable, with a little persistence, it can be overcome.</p>
