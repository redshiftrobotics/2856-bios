<h2>Expert Programmer and github guru</h2>

<p>AJ joined robotics after seeing a Red Shift demonstration prior to high school.  AJ couldnâ€™t stay away and joined the team as soon as he could.  Even though AJ has always considered himself a programmer at heart, FIRST Robotics has exposed him to the hardware and building side of development.  What he has learned regarding time management and being a team player are central to his success.</p>

<p>AJ hopes to be a system administrator and continue his passion in politics.</p>
