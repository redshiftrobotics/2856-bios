<h2>Lead Programmer. Drive Team Member</h2>

<p>Isaac has been a central figure on the programming team for all of his time at Red Shift.  He has been on the drive team for three straight year, which shows that he can perform under pressure and adapt to the craziness of FTC competitions.  Outside of robotics, Isaac is interested in Paninis, ping pong, PID, and piano.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>He fondly remembers Samin’s feeble excuses that he “didn’t eat all the m&ms” and excuses that he can eat as much popcorn as he wants because it’s “guilt-free”.</p>

<p><strong>Current outside project:</strong></p>
<p>Create a robot that climbs the four story science building.</p>
