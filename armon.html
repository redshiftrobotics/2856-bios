<h2>Master Designer and Builder Savant</h2>

<p>Armon came onto the Red Shift team when he was inspired by head mentor, Gabe Cronin, to explore something new.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>When the team traveled to the Idaho state competition in 2015 and the bonding experiences he had with his teammates there. Outside of robotics, Armon likes soccer, coding, video games, and board games.</p>

<p><strong>What he has learned from FIRST:</strong></p>
<p>Through FIRST, he has learned about competitive integrity and how to deal with losses. His mind has changed, from seeing losses as the end of the world to seeing them as an opportunity to learn and become successful.</p>
