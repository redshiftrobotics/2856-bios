<h2>Master Builder and Fashion Consultant</h2>

<p>As a little kid, he would always build contraptions for fun, like a hovercraft in 4th grade, but he always lacked access to materials and never had a goal. His older brother joined Red Shift Robotics and he would help his brother come up with ideas, which led him to finally joining when he could. Outside of robotics, Peter plays lacrosse, ultimate frisbee, and musical instruments, as well as singing and doing visual arts.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>His favorite memory is when his team last year, 6157, won the notebook award and made it to state! They ran down from their seats and he was ecstatic.</p>

<p><strong>What he has learned from FIRST:</strong></p>
<p>Peter has greatly deepened his love for mechanics and has had the opportunity to practice his skills.</p>
