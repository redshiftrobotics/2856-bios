<h2>Java and Android Programming Expert</h2>

<p>Matt, a sophomore, has been a programmer for Red Shift for two years. He joined to grow a larger skill set around programming and turns out, he likes a lot more about it too!</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>His favorite memory is from his first year on 6157 and learning their robot was a few inches too large the night before competition. They had to shorten the drawer slide arm, which involved having to cut down all of the sections of the slide while still maintaining full functionality. It was late and everyone worked together and eventually, found a way to cut them down without the bearings falling out. It was frantic, but everyoneâ€™s energy was good and learned how to solve a problem rapidly with high stakes.</p>

<p><strong>What he has learned from FIRST:</strong></p>
<p>From FIRST, Matt has learned collaborative programming, which he has never experienced outside of FIRST. He also learned version control, namely GIT, and now uses it in and out of robotics.</p>
