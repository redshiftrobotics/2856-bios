<h2>Builder Extraordinaire And Inspiring Designer</h2>

<p>He joined because he always wanted to build a robot. While vague, itâ€™s true. He thought they were cool and wanted to design, build, and drive one in a competitive environment. Outside of robotics, Wilson CADs, does architectural design, and loves the outdoors.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite memory:</strong></p>
<p>His most memorable experience was also one of his most stressful ones. His scissor lift from last year was not completely done and they noticed during a match that the most important bar had snapped. They had to replace it for the next match and only had 4 matches to do it! They took apart half the lift, drilled a new hole, and built the entire thing. It was very stressful, but they finished in time!

<p><strong>What he has learned from FIRST:</strong></p>
<p>Out of FIRST, Wilson has learned technical skills with metal, laser cutters, 3D printers, and electronics. He has expanded his skills of CAD and has made some great friends.</p>
